## üèÉ Migration Steps to v2.0.1
Change the source url in your terraform file to point to v2.0.0 release
```code
module "dmrpp-generator" {
source = "https://github.com/ghrcdaac/dmrpp-generator/releases/download/v2.0.1/dmrpp-generator.zip"
...
}
``` 
Change the value of your docker image to point to v2.0.1 tag
```code
module "dmrpp-generator" {
...
docker_image = "ghrcdaac/dmrpp-generator:v2.0.1"
}



## üèÉ Migration Steps to v2.0.0
Change the source url in your terraform file to point to v2.0.0 release
```code
module "dmrpp-generator" {
source = "https://github.com/ghrcdaac/dmrpp-generator/releases/download/v2.0.0/dmrpp-generator.zip"
...
}
``` 
Change the value of your docker image to point to v2.0.0 tag
```code
module "dmrpp-generator" {
...
docker_image = "ghrcdaac/dmrpp-generator:v2.0.0"
}

```

## Features added to v2.0.0
Now you can pass DMRPP options via collection definition.
For more info about DMRPP options please refer to [DMRPP Documentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZTeWjk6bUBgKP5iD2NVb_Ur8ZcvOpVbfd7pAl8c5bCs/edit#slide=id.p)

```code
{
  "name" : "foo"
  ...
  "meta": {
      "dmrpp": {
        "create_missing_cf" : "-M"    
      }
      ...
  }
  ...
}
```
`create_missing_cf` is an arbitrary key name, you can achieve the same result by passing
```code
{
  "name" : "foo"
  ...
  "meta": {
      "dmrpp": {
        "option1" : "-M"    
      }
      ...
  }
  ...
}
```
For more supported DMRPP options (example `-v`)
```code
```code
{
  "name" : "foo"
  ...
  "meta": {
      "dmrpp": {
        "option1" : "-M",
        "option2" : "-v"    
      }
      ...
  }
  ...
}
```
